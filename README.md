# dqn-segmentation
A Deep Q-Network based Reinforcement Learning agent that can perform the NLP task of segmenting a chunk of given texts based on their semantic meaning and context. The taken approach is to feed a window of sentences into the DQN and the agent has discrete actions to determine at what index does a new segment lie or is there no segment in the given window at all. Except for tweaks and optimizations, the approach does seem to work, how well though is a mystery yet unsolved. Work under progress.
